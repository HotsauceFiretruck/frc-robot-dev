                Regarding 'turn robot to direction':
                - I don't think that gyroscope is even necessary,
                  we can calculate direction or even velocity
                  from previous x and y position and it would probably be more accurate.
                  However, just in case lets leave this here for now.
            run robot until distance is reached
